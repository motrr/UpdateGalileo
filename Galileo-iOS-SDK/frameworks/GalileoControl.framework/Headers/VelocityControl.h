/** The VelocityControl object allows you to control Galileo's angular velocity for a given axis. You can access the instance through the `velocityControlForAxis:` method of the `Galileo` singleton instance.
 
 Control is performed by setting a target velocity. Galileo will attempt to accelerate to reach the target velocity as fast and as smoothly as possible. Setting the target velocity whilst Galileo is already moving will cause Galileo to immediately begin accelerating towards the new target velocity. Once the target velocity is reached, Galileo will continue moving at a constant velocity until a new target velocity is supplied.
